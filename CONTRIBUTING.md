# Commit Messages
Commit messages should contain a short description on the contents of the commit, then a more comprehensive change list underneath. If the commit solves any open issues, link the issue inside the commit. 

# Linting
Make sure your code is up to the linting standards set by the [ESLint config](./backend/.eslintrc.js)

# How to contribute
- Create a fork of [Booker's repository](https://github.com/booker1337/booker_mvp)
- Make your changes
- Create a pull request to `master`

Of course, this will change at a later date to be more comprehensive when/if we get more contributors.
